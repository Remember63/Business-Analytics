some races show correlation to poverty. 
For white, population percentage and poverty are negatively corrected. 
For black, population percentage and poverty are positively correlated.
•	Design: 
Limited my analysis to only 2 races, white and black, instead of comparing all the races with poverty; 
changed to 1 color only to show the relationship across US; 
changed to show the data in state level so that the visual doesn’t look too busy.
